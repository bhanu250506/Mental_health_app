Aura - AI Mental Health Chatbot 🧘✨
Aura is a full-stack, AI-powered mobile application designed to be a safe, supportive, and non-judgmental space for users to track their moods, engage in wellness exercises, and chat with an empathetic AI assistant. This project was built from the ground up to showcase a modern, production-ready mobile application using Flutter for the frontend and a Node.js backend powered by Google's Gemini API.
